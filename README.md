# Insight
Insight is an interactive story in the style of old-school RPG games based on the book by Ray Gard. A mixture of detective and action movie in a sci-fi setting.

The ship of the mercenary Stig Spyro was damaged after a serious battle. In order to get some money for repairs, he decides to call on the order. There were five especially brutal murders at the nearest industrial station. According to rumors, a scumbag maniac wound up there. But it seems that everything is not so simple..
